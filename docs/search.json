It is followed by Wyoming (21.78%) and Arkansas (21.77%) who have similar rates of hesitancy. Vermont has the lowest rates of hesitancy (4.03%). Based on this visualization and the difference from maximum to minimum of estimate rates I would conclude that hesitancy rates and states are correlated. The color coded grouping of region also allows to see if there is a possible correlation between region and vaccine hesitancy. Based on the figure the South appears to be more hesitant and the Northeast on average is less hesitant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Average Hesitancy Rates and Non Hesitancy Rates by State Montana has the highest rates of hesitancy (25.14%) and the lowest rates of non hesitancy (27.74%). It is followed by Wyoming (21.78%) and Arkansas (21.77%) who have similar rates of hesitancy. However, Arkansas (36.05%) has higher rates of non hesitancy than Wyoming (33.96%). Vermont (4.03%) has the lowest rates of hesitancy and Massachusetts (4.63%) has the second lowest rates of hesitancy. However Massachusetts (85.13%) has the highest rates of non hesitancy. Based on this visualization I would conclude that hesitancy and non hesitancy appear to be inversely related and the higher the rate of hesitancy, the lower the rate of non hesitancy. I would also conclude that the variance of mean hesitancy rates and non hesitancy rates differ by states indication a correlation between state and hesitancy rates. By region, the south appears to be clustered together with higher hesitancy rates and lower not hesitant rates. The Northeast appears to be clustered with low rates of hesitancy and high rates on non hesitancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Average Hesitancy Rates by Social Vulnerability Index Very high vulnerability has the highest median estimated hesitancy (16.76%). Very low vulnerability has the lowest median rates of hesitancy (10.55%). This is interesting because you would think that the higher vulnerability would not be quite so hesitant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Average Hesitancy Rates by CVAC Very high concern has the highest median estimated hesitancy (16.80%). Low concern has the lowest median rates of hesitancy (10.18%). This makes sense that areas where there is very high concern of vaccine rollout challenges could be high levels of hesitancy. For example, misinformation could be the cause of high levels of hesitancy and cause challenges to vaccine rollouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Average Hesitancy Rates by Ethnicity Some groups like non-Hispanic Asians appear to have lower overall hesitancy, while groups such as non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native show a wider spread and higher average hesitancy."

Vaccination plays a crucial role in controlling the pandemic by reducing the spread of the virus, preventing severe illness, and decreasing hospitalization and death rates. The COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to be highly effective in boosting immunity and protecting not only individuals but also communities by contributing to herd immunity. However, hesitancy has been influenced by factors such as misinformation, distrust in healthcare systems or government authorities, concerns about the speed of vaccine development, and fears about potential side effects. Social, cultural, and political contexts have also shaped people’s attitudes toward vaccines. Addressing vaccine hesitancy requires comprehensive public health strategies that include transparent communication, community engagement, and efforts to build trust by addressing the specific concerns and barriers faced by different populations.\nThe CDC has published a data set about vaccine Hesitancy for COVID-19 in 2021. This data set has various demographic information showing information by county, state, ethnicity, and vulnerability. Hesitancy is measured by percentage of the population. This data set also looks into varying levels of hesitancy: hesitant, hesitant or unsure, or strongly hesitant. Data set origin: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19-County-and-local-es/q9mh-h2tw/about_data\nMy objective is to observe any possible correlations between demographic and geological factors and the rates of vaccine hesitancy.\nResearch Question Are there any correlations between demographic and geological factors and the rates of vaccine hesitancy?\nMethods Data Cleaning and Wrangling A csv file downloaded to my files from the CDC website was read into a data frame. Rows with NA were removed. One of the data columns held latitude and longitudinal information in the data type “Point”. So, I coded two new variable columns for latitude and longitude so it is in a more usable form for future visualizations.\nAggregate Hesitancy Rates by State I created a new data frame with State as the primary key and get the mean hesitancy. I created a new data frame with State as the primary key and get the mean not hesitant. The mean not hesitant was calculated by subtracting hesitant, hesitant or unsure, and strongly hesitant from 100. Join these two dfs to have a df with both hesitancy variables. Make another df with state as primary key and add lat and long variables. Merge with the hesitancy table to have a table with pk: state and variables: estimated hesitant, not hesitant, lat, long. The summary statistics are tabulated as follows.\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics for Vaccine Hesitancy\n\n\nMean Hesitant (%)\nSD Hesitant\nMin Hesitant (%)\nMax Hesitant (%)\nMean Not Hesitant (%)\nSD Not Hesitant\nMin Not Hesitant (%)\nMax Not Hesitant (%)\n\n\n\n\n12.37017\n5.2458\n4.026429\n25.13857\n61.69957\n15.01524\n27.73661\n85.12571\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregate Hesitancy Rates by Ethnicity The data set has columns for each ethnicity and the percentage of that ethnicity in the region. I made a new cat column that’s value is the predominant ethnicity of that location. I then averaged the estimated hesitancy grouping by ethnicity.\nethnicities &lt;- c(“Percent Hispanic”, “Percent non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native”, “Percent non-Hispanic Asian”, “Percent non-Hispanic Black”, “Percent non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander”, “Percent non-Hispanic White”)\n#Use max.col to determine the predominant ethnicity data$Predominant_Ethnicity &lt;- colnames(data[ethnicities])[max.col(data[ethnicities], ties.method = “first”)]\n#Print the first few rows to verify the new column #head(data[c(“State”, “Predominant_Ethnicity”)])\n#Calculate the average estimated hesitant percentage per state ethnicity_df &lt;- aggregate(data\\('Estimated hesitant', by = list(data\\)’Predominant_Ethnicity’), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE) colnames(ethnicity_df) &lt;- c(“ethnicity”, “Estimated_Hesitant”)\nethnicity_df\\(ethnicity &lt;- gsub(\"Percent \", \"\", ethnicity_df\\)ethnicity)"
