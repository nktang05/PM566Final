It is followed by Wyoming (21.78%) and Arkansas (21.77%) who have similar rates of hesitancy. Vermont has the lowest rates of hesitancy (4.03%). Based on this visualization and the difference from maximum to minimum of estimate rates I would conclude that hesitancy rates and states are correlated. The color coded grouping of region also allows to see if there is a possible correlation between region and vaccine hesitancy. Based on the figure the South appears to be more hesitant and the Northeast on average is less hesitant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Average Hesitancy Rates and Non Hesitancy Rates by State Montana has the highest rates of hesitancy (25.14%) and the lowest rates of non hesitancy (27.74%). It is followed by Wyoming (21.78%) and Arkansas (21.77%) who have similar rates of hesitancy. However, Arkansas (36.05%) has higher rates of non hesitancy than Wyoming (33.96%). Vermont (4.03%) has the lowest rates of hesitancy and Massachusetts (4.63%) has the second lowest rates of hesitancy. However Massachusetts (85.13%) has the highest rates of non hesitancy. Based on this visualization I would conclude that hesitancy and non hesitancy appear to be inversely related and the higher the rate of hesitancy, the lower the rate of non hesitancy. I would also conclude that the variance of mean hesitancy rates and non hesitancy rates differ by states indication a correlation between state and hesitancy rates. By region, the south appears to be clustered together with higher hesitancy rates and lower not hesitant rates. The Northeast appears to be clustered with low rates of hesitancy and high rates on non hesitancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Average Hesitancy Rates by Social Vulnerability Index Very high vulnerability has the highest median estimated hesitancy (16.76%). Very low vulnerability has the lowest median rates of hesitancy (10.55%). This is interesting because you would think that the higher vulnerability would not be quite so hesitant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Average Hesitancy Rates by CVAC Very high concern has the highest median estimated hesitancy (16.80%). Low concern has the lowest median rates of hesitancy (10.18%). This makes sense that areas where there is very high concern of vaccine rollout challenges could be high levels of hesitancy. For example, misinformation could be the cause of high levels of hesitancy and cause challenges to vaccine rollouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Average Hesitancy Rates by Ethnicity Some groups like non-Hispanic Asians appear to have lower overall hesitancy, while groups such as non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native show a wider spread and higher average hesitancy."

Vaccination plays a crucial role in controlling the pandemic by reducing the spread of the virus, preventing severe illness, and decreasing hospitalization and death rates. The COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to be highly effective in boosting immunity and protecting not only individuals but also communities by contributing to herd immunity. However, hesitancy has been influenced by factors such as misinformation, distrust in healthcare systems or government authorities, concerns about the speed of vaccine development, and fears about potential side effects. Social, cultural, and political contexts have also shaped people’s attitudes toward vaccines. Addressing vaccine hesitancy requires comprehensive public health strategies that include transparent communication, community engagement, and efforts to build trust by addressing the specific concerns and barriers faced by different populations.\nThe CDC has published a data set about vaccine Hesitancy for COVID-19 in 2021. This data set has various demographic information showing information by county, state, ethnicity, and vulnerability. Hesitancy is measured by percentage of the population. This data set also looks into varying levels of hesitancy: hesitant, hesitant or unsure, or strongly hesitant. Data set origin: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19-County-and-local-es/q9mh-h2tw/about_data\nMy objective is to observe any possible correlations between demographic and geological factors and the rates of vaccine hesitancy.\nResearch Question Are there any correlations between demographic and geological factors and the rates of vaccine hesitancy?\nMethods Data Cleaning and Wrangling A csv file downloaded to my files from the CDC website was read into a data frame. Rows with NA were removed. One of the data columns held latitude and longitudinal information in the data type “Point”. So, I coded two new variable columns for latitude and longitude so it is in a more usable form for future visualizations.\nAggregate Hesitancy Rates by State I created a new data frame with State as the primary key and get the mean hesitancy. I created a new data frame with State as the primary key and get the mean not hesitant. The mean not hesitant was calculated by subtracting hesitant, hesitant or unsure, and strongly hesitant from 100. Join these two dfs to have a df with both hesitancy variables. Make another df with state as primary key and add lat and long variables. Merge with the hesitancy table to have a table with pk: state and variables: estimated hesitant, not hesitant, lat, long. The summary statistics are tabulated as follows.\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics for Vaccine Hesitancy\n\n\nMean Hesitant (%)\nSD Hesitant\nMin Hesitant (%)\nMax Hesitant (%)\nMean Not Hesitant (%)\nSD Not Hesitant\nMin Not Hesitant (%)\nMax Not Hesitant (%)\n\n\n\n\n12.37017\n5.2458\n4.026429\n25.13857\n61.69957\n15.01524\n27.73661\n85.12571\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregate Hesitancy Rates by Ethnicity The data set has columns for each ethnicity and the percentage of that ethnicity in the region. I made a new cat column that’s value is the predominant ethnicity of that location. I then averaged the estimated hesitancy grouping by ethnicity.\nethnicities &lt;- c(“Percent Hispanic”, “Percent non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native”, “Percent non-Hispanic Asian”, “Percent non-Hispanic Black”, “Percent non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander”, “Percent non-Hispanic White”)\n#Use max.col to determine the predominant ethnicity data$Predominant_Ethnicity &lt;- colnames(data[ethnicities])[max.col(data[ethnicities], ties.method = “first”)]\n#Print the first few rows to verify the new column #head(data[c(“State”, “Predominant_Ethnicity”)])\n#Calculate the average estimated hesitant percentage per state ethnicity_df &lt;- aggregate(data\\('Estimated hesitant', by = list(data\\)’Predominant_Ethnicity’), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE) colnames(ethnicity_df) &lt;- c(“ethnicity”, “Estimated_Hesitant”)\nethnicity_df\\(ethnicity &lt;- gsub(\"Percent \", \"\", ethnicity_df\\)ethnicity)"

Data set origin: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/covid19_mortality_final/COVID19.htm\nResearch Question Are there any correlations between demographic, geographical, and social factors and the rates of vaccine hesitancy?\nIdentify a health-related outcome variable that you want to assess The heath variable I am going to assess is rates of vaccine hesitancy.\nIdentify 2 independent variables that may be associated with that health outcome The first independent variable is social vulnerability index (SVI). SVI is measure of how much a community is vulnerable based on things like socioeconomic status, minority status, and housing. Higher SVI scores may reflect structural barriers and lower trust in public health, potentially leading to higher vaccine hesitancy. The second independent variable is vaccine coverage index (CVAC). VAC measures supply and demand challenges to vaccine rollout based on healthcare accessibility barriers, sociodemographic barriers, and historic undervaccination. Higher CVAC scores indicate greater challenges in vaccine distribution, which may correlate with increased hesitancy. The third independent variable is predominant ethnicity. Cultural factors may influence vaccine hesitancy among specific groups.\nIdentify 1 independent variable that may be a confounder, and 1 independent variable that may be an effect modifier  The first possible confounder is % Adults of fully vaccinated. It may be a confounder because higher vaccination rates could reduce hesitancy by normalizing it or reflecting better healthcare infrastructure. At the same time, vaccination rates may also reflect better healthcare infrastructure which could influence predictors like SVI and CVAC. The second possible confounder is % Bachelors degree or above. It may be a confounder because higher educational attainment is often associated with greater health literacy and lower vaccine hesitancy. Communities with higher education levels might have lower SVI scores and higher CVAC scores due to better socioeconomic conditions.\nThe first possible effect modifier is region. It may be an effect modifier because vaccine hesitancy patterns vary across regions due to cultural, political, and healthcare access differences. The second possible effect modifier is covid death rates per 100,000. It may be an effect modifier because higher death rates may increase the perceived threat of COVID-19, modifying the relationship between predictors like CVAC or SVI and vaccine hesitancy."

CVAC was statistically significant with a p-value &lt;.001 and a coefficient of 7.11, indicating for every unit increase in CVSC, hesitancy percentage is expected to increase by 7.11. Percent of adults fully vaccinated was statistically significant with a p-value &lt;.001 and a coefficient of 0.07, indicating for every unit increase in SVI, hesitancy percentage is expected to decrease by 0.07. Education was statistically significant with a p-value &lt;.001 and a coefficient of 0.63, indicating for every unit increase in percent educated, hesitancy percentage is expected to decrease by 0.63. Covid deaths were not statistically significant indicating that they have no direct correlation with hesitancy levels. When looking at ethnicity with non hispanic white being the baseline, all other ethnicity groups are more likely to be hesitant except Hispanic. With the midwest as the baseline, all other regions are more likely to be more hesitant except the northeast which would be less hesitant."

    "text": "Section 2: Check for confounders\nI checked if percent adults fully vaccinated and education percentage were confounders on the independent variables, SVI, CVAC, and predominant ethnicity. From running the different models, percent adults fully vaccinated does not appear to be a confounder because the coefficients of the independent variables are similar to the coefficients in the model ran with this possible confounder. However, education appears to be a possible confounders. The initial model has the SVI coefficient at 1.40 and when adjusted for education is .60. It is important to note that in the model adjusting for education the SVI is no longer statistically significant. The initial model has the CVAC coefficient at 6.38 and when adjusted for education is 3.58 and is statisticallly significant. The model with education also has a R-squared of .50, higher than the original model with R-squared at .20, indicating a better fit when adjusted for education."

Observations: The residuals should be randomly scattered around the horizontal line at 0. Your Plot: There is a slight curve in the residuals, indicating possible non-linearity in the relationship between predictors and the outcome. Additionally, the spread of residuals increases slightly for larger fitted values, suggesting potential heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance). Action: Consider transforming the predictors or response variable or adding interaction or polynomial terms.\nNormal Q-Q Plot (Top Right) Purpose: Checks whether residuals follow a normal distribution. Observations: Residuals should fall along the diagonal reference line. Your Plot: Most points lie close to the line, but there are deviations in the tails (especially at the upper end), suggesting mild non-normality. Action: If severe, apply a transformation to the response variable (e.g., log or square root) or use robust regression techniques if outliers are influential.\nScale-Location (Bottom Left) Purpose: Checks for homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals). Observations: The residuals should appear randomly scattered with no discernible pattern. Your Plot: The trend line shows a slight upward curve, indicating that variance increases as fitted values increase (heteroscedasticity). Action: Apply a variance-stabilizing transformation (e.g., log or square root) or consider weighted least squares regression to address heteroscedasticity.\nResiduals vs Leverage (Bottom Right) Purpose: Identifies influential observations and checks for high leverage points. Observations: Look for points with high leverage or influence (Cook’s distance). Your Plot: There are a few points with higher leverage (e.g., labeled as 2603, 10093), but Cook’s distance (dashed lines) suggests they are not highly influential. Action: Investigate these points to determine if they are legitimate observations or potential outliers. If they are problematic, consider removing or applying robust regression techniques. Overall Assessment Non-Linearity and Heteroscedasticity:\n\nEvidence of non-linearity and increasing variance in residuals. Consider transformations or adding interaction/polynomial terms to improve the fit. Normality:\nResiduals are approximately normal, but slight deviations in the tails suggest mild non-normality. Influential Points:\nSome observations with higher leverage, but they do not appear overly influential based on Cook’s distance. Next Steps Address Non-Linearity:\nConsider adding interaction or polynomial terms to better capture the relationships between predictors and the outcome. Address Heteroscedasticity:\nApply a transformation (e.g., log or square root) to stabilize variance or use weighted regression. Investigate Outliers:\nExamine high-leverage points to determine their impact on the model. Would you like guidance on implementing any of these improvements?"

Very low vulnerability has the lowest median rates of hesitancy (10.55%). This is interesting because you would think that the higher vulnerability would not be quite so hesitant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Average Hesitancy Rates by CVAC Very high concern has the highest median estimated hesitancy (16.80%). Low concern has the lowest median rates of hesitancy (10.18%). This makes sense that areas where there is very high concern of vaccine rollout challenges could be high levels of hesitancy. For example, misinformation could be the cause of high levels of hesitancy and cause challenges to vaccine rollouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Average Hesitancy Rates by Ethnicity This graph displays the relationship between the percentage of an ethnicity in a population and the estimated hesitancy levels. Some groups like non-Hispanic Asians appear to have lower overall hesitancy, while groups such as non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native show a wider spread and higher average hesitancy."

Combatting misinformation is essential to counter vaccine myths effectively. When working with diverse populations, interventions should involve collaborations with community leaders and culturally tailored messaging to build trust and address unique barriers faced by diverse groups. Culturally relevant interventions, like Es Tiempo, a campaign raises awareness of cervical cancer prevention among Latinas, has proven to be successful. More data collection and evaluation will help in sustaining vaccination rates across all communities."
