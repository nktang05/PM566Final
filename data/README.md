How to access the data:

The file I used is too big so I have had issues trying to upload it to GitHub so I will provide steps to access the csv file online. 

Data set origin: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19-County-and-local-es/q9mh-h2tw/about_data

On the CDC website there is an export button where you can download a csv of the data set.
